                <p>Gambody is the marketplace where you can buy and sell 3D printing files of characters and objects from renowned and popular video games.</p>
                <div class="h5">3D marketplace of computer/video game related models for 3D printing</div>
                <p>Relying on the growing video/computer gaming trend, Gambody has thought to come to the help of numerous video game fans and 3D printing
                    enthusiasts and came up with the idea of creating a platform for 3D printing models of their favorite heroes, war vehicles, aircrafts,
                    cars and many more, from their beloved video/computer games, to make them emerge from their computer screen into the physical world.</p>
                <p>We focus on a narrow niche of video/computer games related characters and items, as it is something that identifies with the hobby we
                    have been enjoying for several years now. Being huge gamers ourselves, we accepted the challenge of creating an online hub where game
                    fans from all around the world could gather and buy, download, and share exclusive and unique 3D printable files of their favorite
                    heroes and outstanding game vehicles and machines.</p>
                <p>It is easy to join our ever expanding, highly-customizable platform. You can either sign up with your email address, Facebook or Twitter account.
                    You will then be provided with your personal page, where you can upload your own 3D printing files of amazingly crafted models, or you can download
                    other modelers’ files and print them on your 3D printer. It is up to you what you do next with these stunning character models: place them on your
                    desktop or shelf, surprise others or keep adding them to your impressive collection.</p>
                <div class="h5">Buy and sell .STL files for 3D printers </div>
